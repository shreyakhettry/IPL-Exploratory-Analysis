INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE: AN ANALYSIS THROUGH THE YEARS

Introduction

Indian Premier League (IPL) is, an Indian professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league established in 2008. The league, based on a round-robin group and knockout format, has teams in major Indian cities. The brainchild of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the IPL has developed into the most lucrative and popular outlet for the game of cricket. The main objective of the analysis that I will be doing is to understand and observe the data, in turn trying to discover any patterns that can be found through the years. I hope that this analysis either reinforces ideas or challenges some other ideas. I will be dividing my analysis into various sections based on common characteristics. Each graph will be accompanied by a follow-up summary of the graph, my observations and justifications.
