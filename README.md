Date - 4th May, 2021
Description and Overview
Sports analytics is a field that applies data analysis techniques to analyze various components of the sports industry, such as player performance, business performance, recruitment, and more. Indian Premier League (IPL), Indian professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league established in 2008. The main objective of the analysis that I will be doing is to understand and observe the data, in turn trying to discover any patterns that can be found through all the seasons of this tournament. I hope that this analysis either reinforces ideas or challenges some other ideas. I will be dividing my analysis in various sections based on common characteristics. Each graph will be accompanied by a follow-up summary of the graph, my observations and justifications.
Summary/Conclusion
Winning the toss does have a slight advantage, however this is not necessary in every match. Teams usually prefer to win the toss and Field first as chasing totals seems to be the way to go if you want to win. There are many factors that influence this and they should be studied along with many other factors. There is a lot of potential with this data set, a few more elements could be added so as to try and answer more questions. The
 decision after winning the toss also relies in which city and stadium the match is being played in, as each pitch is quite different from one another.
Mumbai Indians have been managed to accrue a lot of wins in the time frame studied, but they have the Chennai Super Kings on their in hot pursuit, who have a higher winning percentage. Mumbai Indians also lead as the Highest Boundary Hitters.Teams that have low number of wins is due to the fact that they have played for 2 seasons or less.
Virat Kohli is the highest run-getter and also spends the maximum time on the striker’s and non-striker’s end. Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-getter throughout the tournament and he also tops the chart for giving the most number of extra runs. Andre Russell has the Best Batting Striking Rate and Rashid Khan has the Best Bowling Strike Rate. MS Dhoni, overall, is the best fielder.
Few number of runs is scored in the 1st over and the maximum number of wickets have been taken in the 1st over. The last few overs have the highest average runs that are scored, and the last over has the lowest number of wickets that has been taken.
There is no one specific pattern that can be found for consecutive years for any of the teams or players. The tournament and the sport itself are quite dynamic in nature and the tables can turn anytime on anyone!

 Description and Links of Resources
● Used the ‘tidyverse’ library and its sub-libraries such as ‘dplyr’, ‘ggplot’, ‘tidyr’ etc
● In Fall 2020 I took up a class called PUBH 490R in which I learned Data Wrangling and Visualization using the ‘tidyverse’ package and hence was able to
implement my learnings in the following tasks that I completed.
● Data Wrangling - Fixed the discrepancies in the two csv files, by correcting and updating the team names as well as updating the city name Bangalore to Bengaluru (changed by the Indian Government in 2014). Created a subset of data in which matches that had no result were excluded. Joined both the
datasets as one data frame.
